## 🎨 Landing Page Design

### What's on the Page

1. **Headline**: "Daily Insights on Blockchain, AI & Building in Web3"
2. **Value Props**: 
   - Real-world insights
   - 15-20 second value
   - UAE-compliant content
3. **Primary CTA**: "Follow on TikTok" (BIG, prominent button)
4. **Secondary CTA**: Email signup (below primary CTA)
5. **Social Proof**: "Join thousands learning..."

### Why This Layout Works

- **Clear Value**: Users understand what they get
- **Single Focus**: Primary action is obvious (Follow)
- **Low Friction**: One click to follow (or sign up)
- **Mobile Optimized**: Most TikTok users are on mobile
- **Fast Loading**: Quick to load = better conversions

## 📊 How TikTok Uses Conversion Data

### Immediate Optimization

When users convert (click Follow), TikTok:

1. **Tracks the Event**: Records the conversion
2. **Analyzes the User**: What characteristics does this converter have?
3. **Finds Similar Users**: Uses machine learning to find more like them
4. **Shows Ads to Similar Users**: Prioritizes your ads to likely converters
5. **Improves Targeting**: Gets better at finding your ideal audience over time

### Lookalike Audiences (Advanced)

After collecting 100+ emails:

1. **Export Emails**: Get list of converters
2. **Upload to TikTok**: Create custom audience
3. **Generate Lookalike**: TikTok finds users similar to your converters (1-3% similarity)
4. **Create New Campaign**: Target lookalike audience
5. **Better Performance**: Lookalikes often convert 2-3x better

## 💰 Budget & Expectations
