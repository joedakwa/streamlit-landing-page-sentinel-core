# Quick Deploy - 5 Minutes!

## What We Need First

1. **Your TikTok Username**: What's your TikTok handle? (e.g., `@joedakwa` → just `joedakwa`)
2. **TikTok Pixel ID**: Get it from TikTok Ads Manager:
   - Go to: **Assets** → **Events** → **Manage** → **Web Events**
   - Click **"Set Up"** or **"Create Pixel"**
   - Copy the Pixel ID (looks like: `C1234567890ABCDEF`)
