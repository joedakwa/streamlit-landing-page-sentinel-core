## Step 1: Get TikTok Pixel ID (Do This First!)

1. **In TikTok Ads Manager**, go to: **Assets** → **Events** → **Manage** → **Web Events**
2. Click **"Set Up"** or **"Create Pixel"**
3. Copy your **Pixel ID** (looks like: `C1234567890ABCDEF`)
4. **Save it** - we'll need it in the next step

## Step 2: Configure Landing Page

Once you have your Pixel ID, we'll update the landing page files.

## Step 3: Deploy Options

Choose one:

- **Vercel** (Free, easiest, recommended)
- **Netlify** (Free, also easy)
